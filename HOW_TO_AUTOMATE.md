# Automation Information (Updated)

This file previously contained instructions for setting up a Firebase Cloud Function for automated daily reminders.

**This is no longer necessary.**

The application has been updated to generate reminders directly on your device. The reminder list is created automatically the first time you open the app each day. This removes the need for a paid Firebase plan ("Blaze") and makes the entire application functional on the free tier.

You can safely ignore or delete the `functions` directory in your project.
